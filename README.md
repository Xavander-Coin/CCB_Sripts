THIS GUIDE IS FOR ROOT USERS -

YOU MUST BE A MEMBER OF THE FOLLOWING GROUP
```
User=root
Group=root
```

Shell script to install a Xavander Masternode on a Linux server running Ubuntu 16.04. Use it on your own risk.
***

## Private Key


Steps generate your own private key. 
1.  Download and install XCZM v1.1.0.0 for Windows -   Download Link  - https://github.com/Xavander-Coin/Xavander-Core/releases
2.  Go to **Tools -> Click "Debug Console"** 
3.  Type the following command: **masternode genkey**  
4. You now have your generated **Private Key**  (MasternodePrivKey)


## VPS installation
First you will need a VPS to continue on with this guide. If you do not have one get one from here [Vultr.](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7424168)

Next step is to download the script on the vps with command below.
```
cd &&  bash -c "$(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xavander-Coin/XCZM_Sripts/master/XCZM_install.sh)"
```

You will have 6 options once you run the command above.
1. This option Will install a fresh MNN VPS instance
2. This option will update your MN wallet on the vps if a network or wallet update is needed.
3. This option will Start XCZM Masternode
4. This option will Stop XCZM Masternode
5. This option will show XCZM Server Status
6. This option will Rebuild XCZM Masternode Index


If you need to go back and either start or stop Concierge just use this command.
```
cd &&  bash -c "$(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xavander-Coin/XCZM_Sripts/master/XCZM_install.sh)"
```
That command above will be your shortcut to control your masternode. 
More commands will come in time.

Once the VPS installation is finished.

Check the block height

```
watch ./xavander-cli getinfo
```

We want the blocks to match whats on the XCZM block explorer

Once they match you can proceed with the rest of the guide.



Once the block height matches the block explorer issue the following command.
```
CTRL and C  at the same time  (CTRL KEY and C KEY)
```
***

## Desktop wallet setup  

After the MN is up and running, you need to configure the desktop wallet accordingly. Here are the steps:  
1. Open the XCZM Desktop Wallet.  
2. Go to RECEIVE and create a New Address: **MN1**  
3. Send **50000** XCZM to **MN1**. You need to send 10000 coins in one single transaction.
4. Wait for 10 confirmations.  
5. Go to **Tools -> Click "Debug Console"** 
6. Type the following command: **masternode outputs**  
7. Go to  **Tools -> "Open Masternode Configuration File"**
8. Add the following entry:
```
Alias Address Privkey TxHash TxIndex
```
## SAMPLE OF HOW YOUR MASTERNODE.CONF SHOULD LOOK LIKE.  (This should all be on one line)  

```
MN1 127.0.0.2:35550 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c0
```


* Alias: **MN1**
* Address: **VPS_IP:PORT**
* Privkey: **Masternode Private Key**

10. Go to **Masternode Tab**. 
If you tab is not shown, please enable it from: **Settings - Options - Wallet - Show Masternodes Tab**
11. Click **Update status** to see your node. If it is not shown, close the wallet and start it again. 
12. Select your MN and right click on the masternode **Start Alias** to start it.
13. Alternatively, open **Debug Console** and type:

```
startmasternode alias 0 MN1 
```

```
./xavander-cli masternode status
